### Hi there ! ðŸ‘‹
 I'm Phillip, a french web developer.
 I'm more focused on back-end development, but I'm working on the front end to become fullstack. I work mainly with PHP and the Symfony framework (which I'm still learning). And on the front, I'm learning React, as well as docker for containerization.
